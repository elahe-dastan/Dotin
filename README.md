# DATIN
A small project using hibernate
This is a simple java project which uses hibernate to connect to the database. 
All it does is to take some information and enter it into the database and show it back to the user whenever needed.

# Installing
This project uses MySQL so there are some points to be considered after cloning it.
First, MySQL runs on port 3306 by default so if you have changed the port number remember to change it in the persistence.xml file too.
Second, the name of the database we have used is DATIN, the name of the user used to connect to MySQL is 'Hanie' and the password is '1234'
so either configure your database in the same way or change the persistence.xml file.
